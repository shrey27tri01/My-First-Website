## About:
This is my first website!!  
I have designed a webpage describing myself, my hobbies and interests, programming languages I know and the projects that I have done so far.  
The different webpages contain different information, including writing content through HTML, styling through CSS, some more styling through SCSS, and some functionalities through JavaScript!!  

## Contents:
My webpage contains 8 files which are:  

#### index.html :
Th main page, or the home page of my webpage. It contains basic information about myself, and links to the other pages.

#### hobbies.html :
